Submitting Assignment 2 for Peer Assessment by Karuna Reddy

The assignment is completed on the same concept of function createVector we have done in the class.
I have used the ginv function in MASS library for computing the inverse of the matrix.
A matrix with name mat <- matrix(1:9,ncol=3,nrow=3,byrow=TRUE) is created before passing it to function.
Note : An inverse of a matrix is only possible on square matrix . So be cautious on passing the matrix ( it should be a square matrix )

I have not put any validation on checking the kind of matrix which is passed to the function

Pseudocodes

1) matrix<-makeCacheMatrix(mat)
2) matrix$get()
3) cacheSolve(matrix)
4) Now if the mat we passed is equal to which is present in Cache then inverse is taken from cache
